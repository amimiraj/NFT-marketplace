#  NFT Marketplace (This is my thesis project)

The NFT marketplace constitutes a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate seamless trading and rental transactions of tokenized assets. Users gain access through registered accounts linked to public keys, ensuring robust security. Notably, all transactions are meticulously recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, underpinning transparency and immutability.




**Used Technologies** : In the development, we have used html, tailwind which is a
CSS framework and react.js for front-end and javascript, Solidity for backend.
Moreover, we have used ERC721 which is a standard for representing ownership of
non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique, Hardhat for development
environment and Goreli which is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) testnet designed to simulate
the behaviour of the Ethereum mainnet and Alchemy that offers a powerful
blockchain or web3 development platform. Below, we are presenting and explaining
a glimpse of it.




To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, run the below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amimiraj/NFT-marketplace.git
cd NFT-marketplace
npm install
npm start
```
