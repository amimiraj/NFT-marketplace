#  NFT Marketplace (This is my thesis project)

The NFT marketplace constitutes a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate seamless trading and rental transactions of tokenized assets. Users gain access through registered accounts linked to public keys, ensuring robust security. Notably, all transactions are meticulously recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, underpinning transparency and immutability.




**Used Technologies** : In the development, we have used Tailwind and React.js for the front-end, JavaScript, and Solidity for the backend. Moreover, we have employed ERC721, a standard for representing ownership of unique non-fungible tokens. Our development stack includes Hardhat for the development environment and Goreli, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) testnet designed to simulate the behavior of the Ethereum mainnet. Additionally, we've leveraged Alchemy, which offers a powerful Blockchain and web3 development platform. Below, we are presenting and explaining
a glimpse of it.




To set up the repository and run the marketplace locally, run the below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amimiraj/NFT-marketplace.git
cd NFT-marketplace
npm install
npm start
```
